Project Overview:
Peer Taught is a platform for students to get help and provide help to their fellow students in a wide variety of subjects.The platform is meant to be an additional tool for students to use in order to succeed in college. 

To launch the platform, use this link here: https://peer-taught.herokuapp.com/

In order to use the platform, students must first register with their school email, (at)colorado(dot)edu. This is a check for the platform to ensure that students are using the platform responsibly and with integrity. There is no anonymity on the platform. Each time a user posts a question or answers a question, they must also submit their email. This ensures that there is some check occurring to keep the platform honest and helpful. Users are able to view the questions they have submitted, along with the answers they have provided in their user profile. 

The user would also be able to search for a particular subject or problem using a keyword search. This allows users to look at all of the previous questions or answers posted about that keyword. 

Once the user has finished using the platform, they would click the “Logout” button in order to end their session.
